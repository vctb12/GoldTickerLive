## Quick usage notes

- Start each session by pasting exactly one phase prompt above.
- Do **not** combine Phase 3a and 3b in the same PR.
- If you only want comment-mode in future sessions, paste the prompt and add:
  `Deliverable: PR comment only, no file creation.`

## Session status update (2026-05-22)

- Phase 1 execution started in branch work:
  - Shared shell renderer introduced (`src/components/site-shell.js`) and adopted across major page
    entry points.
  - Shell guard added (`scripts/node/check-shell-guard.js`) and wired into `npm run validate`.
  - Canonical nav 7-surface contract added to `nav-data` + test coverage.
  - Inline shell-related styles partially extracted to `styles/partials/shell.css`.
- Remaining Phase 1 items should continue from this state (final parity sweep + CI evidence pack).

## Phase 2 planning dependency map (2026-05-22)

- Shared shell and navigation injection is already unified across all three entry points via
  `mountSharedShell()` + `injectBreadcrumbs()` in:
  - `src/pages/learn.js`
  - `src/pages/methodology.js`
  - `src/pages/insights.js`
- Each surface currently owns page-local copy/state logic:
  - `learn.js`: large `CONTENT` map + TOC scroll-spy + cache-backed language preference.
  - `methodology.js`: separate `T` map and independent language toggle flow.
  - `insights.js`: separate `CONTENT` map plus live mini price bar logic.
- Each page has standalone SEO/canonical/head metadata in:
  - `learn.html`
  - `methodology.html`
  - `insights.html`
- Consolidation to a `/learn/` hub will need coordinated updates across:
  - `_redirects` legacy routing behavior (for removed legacy entry points).
  - sitemap generation inputs (`scripts/node/generate-sitemap.js`, `build/generateSitemap.js`).
  - SEO governance/noindex expectations (`scripts/node/seo-governance.js`).
  - sitewide metadata/link tests (notably `tests/seo-sitewide.test.js`, `tests/sitemap.test.js`).
- Safe first leaf chosen:
  - Build a shared learn-hub content model + article renderer module and migrate `learn.html` to use
    that renderer first, while keeping `methodology.html` and `insights.html` intact for a follow-up
    redirect/migration slice.

## Actionable checklist — current next slice

- [x] Complete Phase 1 parity sweep and capture fresh validation evidence (`npm run lint`,
      `npm test`, `npm run validate`, `npm run build`) for the remaining extraction pass.
- [x] Map learn/methodology/insights consolidation dependencies for Phase 2 planning.
- [x] Select first Phase 2 leaf implementation slice with low regression risk.
- [ ] Implement Phase 2 leaf #1: shared learn-hub content model + renderer (learn surface only).
- [ ] Validate Phase 2 leaf #1 with `npm run lint`, `npm test`, `npm run validate`, `npm run build`.

## Session log

### 2026-05-22T14:37Z — copilot (planning slice)

- Slice class: PLAN
- Skills activated: gold-ticker-live-audit
- Completed:
  - Mapped concrete dependencies for Phase 2 consolidation across learn/methodology/insights
    HTML+JS+SEO surfaces.
  - Selected and documented a low-risk first implementation leaf (learn-first renderer migration).
  - Updated next action metadata and actionable checklist for direct execution in the next run.
- Added/Split:
  - Added a dedicated "Phase 2 planning dependency map" section to this plan file.
- Skipped (owner-only / blocked):
  - No runtime code edits in this planning slice.
- Validation:
  - Docs-only planning update; runtime test/lint/build commands intentionally deferred to the first
    implementation slice.
- Next action: Execute Phase 2 leaf #1 by introducing the shared learn-hub content model + renderer
  and migrating only `learn.html`/`src/pages/learn.js` in the first code PR.

### 2026-05-22T13:50Z — copilot (PR #331)

- Slice class: CODE
- Skills activated: gold-ticker-live-audit, frontend-design-system, mobile-ux-review
- Completed:
  - Replaced remaining inline style attributes on active Phase 1 parity surfaces in `tracker.html`
    and `learn.html` with CSS classes.
  - Added class-driven sequencing and purity fill-width rules in `styles/pages/tracker-pro.css` and
    `styles/pages/learn.css`.
  - Captured full required validation evidence for this slice.
- Added/Split:
  - None.
- Skipped (owner-only / blocked):
  - None.
- Validation: lint=PASS, quality=FAIL (pre-existing prettier drift in untouched files), test=FAIL
  (741 run, 1 pre-existing failure in `tests/analytics.test.js`), check-unsafe-dom=PASS, build=PASS,
  check-links=PASS, validate=PASS, playwright=FAIL (138 passed, 96 failed; missing host libs for
  WebKit and pre-existing nav/lang smoke failures)
- Screenshots:
  - `/tmp/playwright-logs/phase1-inline-cleanup-360-ltr.png`
  - `/tmp/playwright-logs/phase1-inline-cleanup-360-rtl.png`
  - `/tmp/playwright-logs/phase1-inline-cleanup-desktop.png`
- Next action: Begin Phase 2 planning by mapping learn/methodology/insights consolidation
  dependencies and selecting the first leaf implementation slice.

### 2026-05-22T13:11Z — copilot (PR #330)

- Slice: Add required status/session metadata and convert current Phase 1 progress into explicit
  actionable checklist state.
- Completed:
  - Added `plan-status` YAML block with `in-progress` state and a concrete `next_action`.
  - Added an actionable checkbox list for the active Phase 1 progress state.
  - Preserved prior progress notes and aligned them with checklist tracking.
- Added/Split:
  - Added one explicit pending leaf item to drive the next run
    (`Complete Phase 1 parity sweep + full validation evidence`).
- Skipped (owner-only / blocked):
  - None.
- Validation:
  - Docs-only plan-state update; no runtime or build-affecting files changed, so repo
    test/lint/build commands were not run in this slice.
- Next action: Complete the Phase 1 parity sweep by auditing remaining shell-style extraction gaps
  and capturing full lint/test/validate/build evidence.
