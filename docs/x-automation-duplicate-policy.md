# X / Twitter automation: duplicate-post policy

X rejects update text equal to a recent post (HTTP 403, error code
187 — "Status is a duplicate"). This is enforced server-side; the bot
must skip unchanged content rather than try to force it through with
random punctuation, invisible characters, or other cosmetic tricks.
Doing so risks an automation-rule violation against the account.

This doc describes how `scripts/python/post_gold_price.py` and
`scripts/python/tweet_guard.py` cooperate to make the bot
duplicate-safe and freshness-honest.

---

## 1. Failure mode we're guarding against

The historical pattern with GoldPriceZ:

- Bot wakes every 6 minutes.
- GoldPriceZ returns the **same price + same timestamp** for 30–45 minutes.
- Old bot generated nearly-identical tweet text → X rejected with 403.
- Logs filled with duplicate-post errors and the account got noisy.

The fix is twofold:

1. **Don't poll the same provider when it's frozen** — the new
   orchestrator (`fetch_gold_price.py`) tries a chain of providers
   and a frozen provider's circuit eventually opens.
2. **Even when polling succeeds, only post when meaningful** — the
   `tweet_guard` module decides.

## 2. Decision rules (in order)

`tweet_guard.decide()` evaluates these in order and returns the first
match. `should_post=False` means the bot exits 0 with a `skip_reason`.

| # | Skip reason                       | Trigger                                                                                                    |
| - | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | `stale_quote`                     | `is_fresh=false` and `ALLOW_STALE_TWEET≠true`. Fresh = `freshness_seconds ≤ MAX_GOLD_FRESHNESS_SECONDS`.   |
| 2 | `provider_timestamp_unchanged`    | Provider timestamp equals the last successful post's, and `FORCE_SUMMARY_AFTER_MINUTES` hasn't elapsed.    |
| 3 | `duplicate_text_hash`             | SHA-256 of generated tweet text equals the last posted hash. Always skipped — X would reject anyway.       |
| 4 | `fallback_no_change`              | `is_fallback=true` (or `source_type` is `cache_last_known` / `spot_delayed`) AND price equals last price.  |
| 5 | `price_move_below_threshold`      | `|move_usd| < MIN_TWEET_MOVE_USD` AND `|move_pct| < MIN_TWEET_MOVE_PCT`, and `FORCE_SUMMARY_AFTER_MINUTES` hasn't elapsed. |

When all five rules pass, the bot posts and updates
`data/last_tweet_state.json`.

The legacy guards (`check_duplicate_guard` and the content-hash check
in `post_gold_price.py`) still run before `tweet_guard.decide()` —
this layer is **additive**.

## 3. Knobs

All env vars; sensible defaults baked into the code so a missing
variable behaves safely.

| Env var                          | Default | Effect |
| -------------------------------- | ------: | ------ |
| `SKIP_DUPLICATE_TWEETS`          | `true`  | Master switch for the new guard. `false` → bypass (tests only). |
| `ALLOW_STALE_TWEET`              | `false` | Allow posting when `is_fresh=false`. Use only for forced summaries with explicit "delayed" copy. |
| `MIN_TWEET_MOVE_USD`             | `1.00`  | Skip below this absolute USD/oz move (when timestamp has changed). |
| `MIN_TWEET_MOVE_PCT`             | `0.03`  | Skip below this percentage move. |
| `FORCE_SUMMARY_AFTER_MINUTES`    | `60`    | Override "no movement" suppression after N minutes since the last post (so the feed always has a recent reference). |
| `DRY_RUN_TWEET`                  | `false` | Run the full pipeline including the guard but never call the X API. Useful for the migration sign-off. |

## 4. State file

`data/last_tweet_state.json` (schema version 1):

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "last_tweet_id": "1900000000000000000",
  "last_tweet_time_utc": "2026-05-01T10:00:00Z",
  "last_tweet_text_hash": "<sha256 hex>",
  "last_price_usd_oz": 4550.0,
  "last_provider": "twelvedata_xauusd",
  "last_provider_timestamp_utc": "2026-05-01T09:59:30Z",
  "last_source_type": "spot_reference",
  "last_post_reason": "price_moved"
}
```

Atomic write semantics: the file is written to `*.tmp` and renamed.
Corrupt or missing files are tolerated and treated as "no prior post."

## 5. Source-type labels (for tweet copy)

The normalized quote payload exposes a `source_type` field. Tweet
templates **must** be honest about it:

| `source_type`         | Suggested copy fragment                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `spot_live`           | "Spot XAU/USD"                                       |
| `spot_reference`      | "Spot reference price"                               |
| `spot_delayed`        | "Delayed spot reference"                             |
| `futures_reference`   | "GCUSD futures reference (not pure spot)"            |
| `commodity_reference` | "Commodity reference price"                          |
| `daily_fix`           | "Daily fix"                                          |
| `cache_last_known`    | "Last known price (provider cached)"                 |
| `unknown`             | "Reference price"                                    |

A fallback (`is_fallback=true`) should additionally include a short
"(fallback source)" disclaimer in the tweet text.

## 6. Why we never bypass X duplicate detection

X's automation rules treat duplicate-bypass tactics
(zero-width-spaces, trailing periods, capitalisation tweaks) as
manipulation. The right answer is to **not post** when the underlying
data hasn't changed. That's the entire point of `tweet_guard.decide()`.

If you find yourself reaching for "let's just append a timestamp
suffix to defeat the duplicate check," the correct action is to ask
why the upstream provider is repeating itself — that's the bakeoff's
job to surface, not the bot's job to paper over.
