# X / Twitter automation: duplicate-post policy

X rejects update text equal to a recent post (HTTP 403, error code 187 — "Status is a duplicate").
This is enforced server-side; the bot must skip unchanged content rather than try to force it
through with random punctuation, invisible characters, or other cosmetic tricks. Doing so risks an
automation-rule violation against the account.

> [`OWNER_ACTIONS_REQUIRED_GOLD_BAKEOFF.md`](./OWNER_ACTIONS_REQUIRED_GOLD_BAKEOFF.md). Before

> `python scripts/python/gold_bakeoff_readiness.py --strict`.

This doc describes how `scripts/python/post_gold_price.py` and `scripts/python/tweet_guard.py`
cooperate to make the bot duplicate-safe and freshness-honest.

Production posture:

- scheduled posting is **hourly**, not every 6 minutes
- manual GitHub `workflow_dispatch` is supported for GitHub UI and iPhone Shortcut triggers
- manual runs still use the cached `data/gold_price.json` source-of-truth and the same GitHub
  guardrails
- `force_post=true` only overrides the cooldown guard; stale and duplicate checks still apply
- long posts are logged and attempted locally; if X rejects them, the API error is surfaced in the
  workflow logs

## 1. Failure mode we're guarding against

The historical pattern with GoldPriceZ:

- Bot wakes every 6 minutes.
- GoldPriceZ returns the **same price + same timestamp** for 30–45 minutes.
- Old bot generated nearly-identical tweet text → X rejected with 403.
- Logs filled with duplicate-post errors and the account got noisy.

The fix is twofold:

1. **Don't poll the same provider when it's frozen** — the new orchestrator (`fetch_gold_price.py`)
   tries a chain of providers and a frozen provider's circuit eventually opens.
2. **Even when polling succeeds, only post when meaningful** — the `tweet_guard` module decides.

## 2. Decision rules (in order)

`tweet_guard.decide()` evaluates these in order and returns the first match. `should_post=False`
means the bot exits 0 with a `skip_reason`.

| #   | Skip reason                    | Trigger                                                                                                   |
| --- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | `stale_quote`                  | `is_fresh=false` and `ALLOW_STALE_TWEET≠true`. Fresh = `freshness_seconds ≤ MAX_GOLD_FRESHNESS_SECONDS`.  |
| 2   | `cooldown_active`              | Last successful tweet was less than `MIN_TWEET_INTERVAL_MINUTES` ago (default 55) and `FORCE_POST≠true`.  |
| 3   | `provider_sample_unchanged`    | Provider price **and** provider timestamp both match the last successful post. Always skipped.            |
| 4   | `provider_timestamp_unchanged` | Provider timestamp equals the last successful post's, and `FORCE_SUMMARY_AFTER_MINUTES` hasn't elapsed.   |
| 5   | `duplicate_text_hash`          | SHA-256 of generated tweet text equals the last posted hash. Always skipped — X would reject anyway.      |
| 6   | `fallback_no_change`           | `is_fallback=true` (or `source_type` is `cache_last_known` / `spot_delayed`) AND price equals last price. |
| 7   | `price_move_below_threshold`   | `                                                                                                         | move_usd | < MIN_TWEET_MOVE_USD`AND` | move_pct | < MIN_TWEET_MOVE_PCT`, and `FORCE_SUMMARY_AFTER_MINUTES` hasn't elapsed. |

When all seven rules pass, the bot posts and updates `data/last_tweet_state.json`.

`post_gold_price.py` prints the generated post text and character count before calling the X API.
The repo no longer skips locally just because the text is longer than 280 characters. X still owns
its own eligibility rules, including Premium / verified longer-post capability, so any external
length rejection should come back from X and be logged by the workflow. Dry-run mode
(`DRY_RUN_TWEET=true`) still evaluates all guards but never posts or mutates state.

The legacy guards (`check_duplicate_guard` and the content-hash check in `post_gold_price.py`) still
run before `tweet_guard.decide()` — this layer is **additive**.

## 3. Knobs

All env vars; sensible defaults baked into the code so a missing variable behaves safely.

| Env var                       | Default | Effect                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SKIP_DUPLICATE_TWEETS`       |  `true` | Master switch for the new guard. `false` → bypass (tests only).                                                                                               |
| `ALLOW_STALE_TWEET`           | `false` | Allow posting when `is_fresh=false`. Use only for forced summaries with explicit "delayed" copy.                                                              |
| `MIN_TWEET_INTERVAL_MINUTES`  |    `55` | Cooldown between successful tweets so scheduled + manual runs do not double-post.                                                                             |
| `MIN_TWEET_MOVE_USD`          |  `1.00` | Skip below this absolute USD/oz move (when timestamp has changed).                                                                                            |
| `MIN_TWEET_MOVE_PCT`          |  `0.03` | Skip below this percentage move.                                                                                                                              |
| `FORCE_SUMMARY_AFTER_MINUTES` |    `60` | Override "no movement" suppression after N minutes since the last post (so the feed always has a recent reference).                                           |
| `FORCE_POST`                  | `false` | Override the cooldown guard only. It does **not** bypass stale or duplicate checks, and it does not change how X enforces its own external post-length rules. |
| `DRY_RUN_TWEET`               | `false` | Run the full pipeline including the guard but never call the X API. Useful for the migration sign-off.                                                        |

## 4. State file

`data/last_tweet_state.json` (schema version 1):

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "last_tweet_id": "1900000000000000000",
  "last_tweet_time_utc": "2026-05-01T10:00:00Z",
  "last_tweet_text_hash": "<sha256 hex>",
  "last_price_usd_oz": 4550.0,
  "last_provider": "twelvedata_xauusd",
  "last_provider_timestamp_utc": "2026-05-01T09:59:30Z",
  "last_source_type": "spot_reference",
  "last_post_reason": "price_moved"
}
```

Atomic write semantics: the file is written to `*.tmp` and renamed. Corrupt or missing files are
tolerated and treated as "no prior post."

## 5. Source-type labels (for tweet copy)

The normalized quote payload exposes a `source_type` field. Tweet templates **must** be honest about
it:

| `source_type`         | Suggested copy fragment                   |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `spot_live`           | "Spot XAU/USD"                            |
| `spot_reference`      | "Spot reference price"                    |
| `spot_delayed`        | "Delayed spot reference"                  |
| `futures_reference`   | "GCUSD futures reference (not pure spot)" |
| `commodity_reference` | "Commodity reference price"               |
| `daily_fix`           | "Daily fix"                               |
| `cache_last_known`    | "Last known price (provider cached)"      |
| `unknown`             | "Reference price"                         |

A fallback (`is_fallback=true`) should additionally include a short "(fallback source)" disclaimer
in the tweet text.

## 6. Why we never bypass X duplicate detection

X's automation rules treat duplicate-bypass tactics (zero-width-spaces, trailing periods,
capitalisation tweaks) as manipulation. The right answer is to **not post** when the underlying data
hasn't changed. That's the entire point of `tweet_guard.decide()`.

If you find yourself reaching for "let's just append a timestamp suffix to defeat the duplicate
check," the correct action is to ask why the upstream provider is repeating itself — that's the
bakeoff's job to surface, not the bot's job to paper over.
