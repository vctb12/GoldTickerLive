# Gold-Prices Site Revamp — master plan

This is the active plan. It owns the homepage / nav / tracker revamp (§0–§18) and the consolidated
production tracks (§19–§28). New proposals are captured under [`docs/plans/`](./plans/); reconcile
them into the right section here before execution. Agent operating rules are in
[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) — this file is the plan, not the charter.

**How to use this file**

- Open the section that matches your task; update its checklist in the same PR that ships the code.
- If a task doesn't fit any existing section, add a subsection rather than starting a parallel plan
  file.
- Keep completed items as `[x]` with enough context to serve as a record. Don't re-open closed items
  to pad status; don't invent new phases to look ambitious.

**Last updated:** 2026-04-25.

## 0. Product context

_Absorbs `docs/product/PRD.md`._

### Product

Gold-Prices website — a bilingual (EN/AR), multi-page, mostly-static site with live data, tools,
country/city/market pages, educational content, and a shops directory.

### Mission

Help users quickly and confidently understand gold prices, historical movement, market context, and
where/how to buy.

### Primary users

- Retail users checking today's prices

- Calculators
- Learn / methodology / guides

### Product non-negotiables

- Label estimated, fallback, and derived values clearly
- Preserve internal linking between pages
- No fake "live" claims without support
- No weak SEO duplication
- No misleading store verification

---

## 0.1 Trust guardrails

_Absorbs `docs/product/PHASE0_GUARDRAILS.md`. These are non-negotiable product rules for trust
language that must land before any broad visual or UX change._

### Purpose

Keep the site explicit about what prices represent and what they do **not** represent. Applies to
all pages that show prices, rates, listings, or market comparisons.

### Core trust rules

1. **Always separate reference prices from retail outcomes.**
   - Use "spot-linked reference estimate" for computed values.
   - Never label computed values as "shop price" unless sourced from a real store feed.
2. **Always label data freshness and source layer.**
   - Every critical price surface must indicate one of: `Live`, `Cached`, `Fallback`,
     `Derived estimate`.
3. **Always expose timing context.**
   - Show timestamp / age where possible (e.g., "Updated 3 min ago").
   - If stale, show "Delayed" or "Stale" state explicitly.
4. **Never imply store verification without evidence.**
   - For market clusters or area listings, use wording such as "Market-area listing" or "Directory
     reference profile".
5. **Always include user next-step guidance.**
   - On shops / listings surfaces, include: "Confirm final prices, making charges, and VAT directly
     with seller."

### Global label taxonomy

Canonical labels to use across UI:

- `Spot/reference estimate`
- `Retail price (from seller)`
- `Live data`
- `Cached data`
- `Fallback value`
- `Derived value`
- `Last reviewed`
- `Methodology`

Avoid ambiguous terms: "accurate retail now", "verified price" (unless provenance is explicit),
"official market price" (unless the source is named).

### Required trust elements by page type

**Tracker pages** must include:

- source-layer label (live / cached / fallback)
- methodology link
- spot-vs-retail distinction
- timestamp or age indicator

**Shops directory and listing detail modal** must include:

- listing-type clarity (store vs market area)
- details availability badge (full / partial / limited)
- "confirm directly with seller" disclaimer
- last-reviewed date for directory content

**Country / city / market guide pages** must include:

- clear separation between benchmark prices and local retail variability
- links to methodology and relevant tracker / shops pages

### Copy pattern rules

- Short, explicit sentences over marketing-heavy claims.
- Prefer "estimate", "reference", "indicative", "derived" where applicable.
- Keep disclaimers informative and actionable.
- Avoid fear language and avoid overconfidence claims.

### PR review checklist (Phase 0 gate)

For any PR touching pricing / listing UI, reviewers must confirm:

- [ ] Spot/reference vs retail is explicit on the changed surface.
- [ ] Live / cached / fallback / derived status is visible where relevant.
- [ ] Timestamp or recency context is present or intentionally not applicable.
- [ ] Trust disclaimer is present and not vague.
- [ ] Methodology link remains discoverable.
- [ ] No wording implies verification without supporting data.

If any item fails, the PR must not be marked complete.

## 0.2 Reusable trust copy snippets

_Absorbs `docs/product/TRUST_SNIPPETS.md`. Use these as defaults for banners, cards, and modals.
Adapt wording to context without changing meaning._

| F   | Freshness label                | "Last reviewed: {date}"                                                                                      |
| G   | Staleness label                | "Data may be delayed. Check timestamp before relying on this value."                                         |
| H   | Method transparency link text  | "See methodology and data sources"                                                                           |

### Usage notes

- Keep one primary trust sentence near the top of each critical page.
- Do not stack multiple long disclaimers above the fold.
- For mobile, prefer concise labels + expandable detail text.

## 0.3 Engineering notes specific to the revamp

General engineering conventions (tokens, DOM safety, motion, RTL, priority order) live in
[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) — not repeated here. Revamp-specific notes:

- Canonical tokens for this work resolve in `styles/global.css` under `--color-*`, `--surface-*`,
  `--space-*`, `--text-*`, `--radius-*`, `--shadow-*`, `--ease-*`, `--duration-*`, `--weight-*`,
  `--leading-*`. Don't introduce bespoke scales alongside them.
- Treat each track (A–J) as a reversible unit. Keep commits focused per concern (tokens / layout /
  motion / a11y / …) so bisection stays cheap, but don't split mechanically into trivial commits
  when one cohesive change is clearer.

## 1. Shipping order

Cycle tracks **A → B → C → D → E → F → G → H → I → J** across rounds. No target commit count; ship
what the next round of work honestly produces.

## 4. Track A — Cross-cutting foundation

Goal: unify the system every other track leans on. Each bullet = 1–2 commits.

- [x] **Motion primitives** in `styles/global.css`: `[data-reveal]` reveal-up, `flash-up`,
      `flash-down`, `pulse-dot`, `underline-slide`, `drawer-slide-in`, `reveal-up`, plus a global
      `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` reset. (commit `788feb14`)
- [x] **Surface utility classes** `.surface-elevated` / `.surface-subtle` / `.surface-accent` /
      `.surface-glass` consumed by nav/home/tracker. (`0d2c40c8`)
- [x] **Spacing rhythm tokens** `--rhythm-inline` / `--rhythm-block` / `--rhythm-section` /
      `--rhythm-section-lg`, plus `--surface-glass` token (light + dark). (`ab3f8dc3`)
- [x] **`IntersectionObserver` primitive** `src/lib/reveal.js` — one shared observer, `WeakSet`
      dedup, auto-runs on DOMContentLoaded, IO-missing fallback reveals immediately. (`82b8d77c`)
- [x] **`count-up` primitive** `src/lib/count-up.js` — rAF easeOutQuad, duration magnitude-capped
      180–800 ms, auto directional `data-flash`, reduced-motion no-op, robust numeric parse.
      (`0b03c603`, `0a3c7591`)
- [x] **Token audit.** Inventoried per-prefix: `--tp-*` in `styles/pages/tracker-pro.css` is already
      fully aliased to canonical site tokens (`--surface-*`, `--border-*`, `--text-*`,
      `--color-gold*`, `--color-live*`, `--color-error*`, `--color-fixed*`, `--shadow-*`,
      `--radius-*`); `--home-*`, `--nav-*`, and `--shops-*` color palettes do not exist (only a
      single `--nav-height` sizing token in `styles/global.css`). `--invest-*` in
      `styles/pages/invest.css` is an intentional dark-premium page identity that differs from the
      canonical dark mode on purpose — not drift. `styles/critical.css` intentionally inlines
      fallback hex for `--tp-bg` / `--tp-text` / `--tp-accent` so above-the-fold paint doesn't
      depend on the deferred global-token sheet.
- [ ] **Canonical card consolidation.** Merge near-duplicate `.card` / `.panel` / `.section-card`
      rules into the canonical `.card` + `.card--accent` + `.card--compact` set.
- [ ] **Heading scale confirmation.** Ensure heading scale is applied via classes (`.h1`…`.h6`) not
      ad-hoc sizes. _Audit (2026-04-23, prior to Slice 2a):_ base `h1`..`h6` element selectors are
      not styled in `styles/global.css`. Every page hand-sizes headings via bespoke selectors (~40
      sites, e.g. `.tracker-hero-copy h1`, `.pricing-hero-content h1`, `.legal-hero h1`,
      `.method-section h2`, `.learn-section h3`). Token gaps: no display-tier sizes (`--text-4xl` /
      `--text-5xl`) for hero headings, and the `--text-*` scale in `styles/global.css` drifts from
      the one documented in [`docs/DESIGN_TOKENS.md`](DESIGN_TOKENS.md) (e.g. `--text-3xl` is
      `1.875rem` in code but `2.25rem` in docs). Split into four sequenced slices: - [x] **Slice 1
      (tokens).** Added `--text-4xl: 2.25rem` / `--text-5xl: 3rem` display-tier tokens to
      `styles/global.css`; reconciled `docs/DESIGN_TOKENS.md` to match the implemented body scale
      (doc→code — the shipped tight 17–20 px body scale is intentional for dense price-data UI). -
      [x] **Slice 2a (typography — utility classes).** Added `.h1`…`.h6` utility classes plus a
      `.display-1` opt-in class in `styles/global.css`. Purely additive — no base `h1..h6` element
      rules, no existing selectors touched. New markup should prefer these classes. - [ ] **Slice 2b
      (typography — base element baseline).** Add base `h1..h6` element rules that match the class
      scale, scoped to resets/layouts where no page override exists. Must be preceded by a per-page
      audit because the ~40 bespoke selectors already dominate specificity. - [ ] **Slice 3
      (cleanup).** Migrate per-page hand-sized heading selectors to the canonical classes, one page
      per commit.
- [x] **Focus ring token audit.** Canonical `:focus-visible` baseline in `styles/global.css` uses
      `--focus-ring-width` / `--focus-ring-color` / `--focus-ring-offset`. Page-level outline
      overrides normalized to the same tokens: `.calc-tab`, `.tracker-mode-tab`,
      `.shops-control--checkbox input[type='checkbox']`, `.shops-filter-toggle`, and `.btn`.
      `.methodology-link` relies on the baseline (no override). _Follow-up (separate concern, not
      this audit):_ sites that intentionally suppress `outline` in favor of a custom box-shadow or
      color-only cue — `.karat-pill`, `.shops-chip`, `.shops-clear-btn`, `.modal-close-cta`,
      `.stub-cta`, `.stub-related-link` — need a dedicated a11y review to decide whether the
      alternative ring is visible enough.

## 5. Track B — Navigation rebuild

> **Progress note (Track B data + dropdown enrichment pass):** B.1 data model, B.4 dropdown row
> anatomy (icon + label + description + primary emphasis + layout hint), B.5 command-palette
> shortcuts (`/`, `Ctrl/Cmd+K`) + recent-searches + safe-DOM result rendering, B.6 details-based
> mobile drawer groups, and B.10 dark-mode-aware nav tokens are shipped in this branch. The
> `src/components/nav.js` unsafe-DOM baseline tightened from 5 → 2 sinks.
>
> **Progress note (Track B polish pass):** B.2 scrolled-state elevation, B.3 animated underline
> slide under group triggers (reduced-motion aware), B.4 split 180 ms open / 120 ms close panel
> timings, B.6 drawer `100svh` fallback + bottom-cluster slot, B.7 scroll hide/reveal with
> `data-nav-hidden` + rAF throttling (suspended while dropdown/drawer open, reduced-motion, or near
> top), and B.8 theme-toggle icon rotate per mode are shipped in the same branch. Full Playwright
> a11y sweep remains deferred.

### B.1 IA & data shape

- [x] Keep 5-group IA (Home · Prices · Tools · Learn · More, solo Shops) but **split "More"** — move
      high-value items up where possible. Audit for ambiguity.
- [x] Enforce `description` on every group child in `nav-data.js`; trim labels for parallelism;
      ensure bilingual pairs. _(tests/nav-data.test.js now enforces EN/AR parity + non-empty
      description on every item)_
- [x] Tag **primary destinations** (Tracker, Calculator, Shops, Countries) vs **secondary** (Learn
      articles) so the UI can emphasize them. _(primary flag parity enforced in tests)_

### B.2 Desktop shell

- [x] Sticky top bar, glass surface (`backdrop-filter: blur`, `--surface-glass`), bottom hairline
      `--border-default`. _(`.site-nav[data-scrolled='true']` elevates shadow + border tint; base
      blur already in place)_
- [ ] Left: brand lockup. Center: group links. Right: utility cluster (search trigger · language ·
      theme · CTA "Live Tracker").
- [x] Group links as buttons opening dropdown on hover **and** click/Enter/Space/Down. Touch users
      get click (no hover trap). _(shipped; hover handled via CSS `:hover .nav-dropdown-panel`)_
- [x] 44 px minimum tap targets; visible `:focus-visible` rings using `--focus-ring`. _(applied to
      `.nav-icon-btn`, `.nav-dropdown-item`, `.nav-search-*`)_

### B.3 Active state

- [x] On page load, compute current URL → find matching group + sub-item; add `aria-current="page"`
      to the item and `data-active="true"` to its parent group. _(data-active now set by
      `buildDropdown`)_
- [x] Animated underline that slides between groups on hover/focus, snaps to active on mouseleave.
      Disabled under reduced motion. _(`.nav-link::after` / `.nav-dropdown-btn::after` scaleX
      transition; gated by `prefers-reduced-motion`)_

### B.4 Dropdown panels

- [x] Two-column layout for Prices + Tools, one-column for Learn + More. _(data-driven via
      `group.layout` hint + `.nav-dropdown-panel-items[data-layout]` CSS grid)_
- [x] Each item: label + one-line description from `nav-data.js`, optional leading icon. _(rendered
      as `nav-dropdown-item-icon` + `nav-dropdown-item-body`)_
- [x] Open: fade + translate-Y 4 px, 180 ms `--ease-out`. Close: 120 ms. Reduced-motion: instant.
      _(split transitions on `.nav-dropdown-panel` vs `.nav-dropdown.is-open .nav-dropdown-panel`)_
- [x] First item receives focus on open. `Escape` closes and returns focus to trigger.
      `ArrowUp`/`ArrowDown` cycle. `Tab` exits. _(already wired in
      `navEl.querySelectorAll('.nav-dropdown-panel')` keydown handlers)_

### B.5 Command-palette search

- [x] Progressive enhancement: `<a href="/content/search/">Search</a>` is the fallback. _(still
      present in Tools group)_
- [x] JS-enhanced overlay triggered by search icon, `/`, or `Ctrl/Cmd+K`. _(`/` and `Ctrl/Cmd+K`
      listeners added in `initNavSearch`; ignored while focus is in an
      input/textarea/contentEditable)_
- [x] Queries page titles + country/city/market slugs + tool names via `src/lib/search.js`. _(via
      the existing `src/search/searchEngine.js` lazy import)_
- [x] Keyboard-first: arrow keys, Enter, Esc. Results grouped (Pages · Countries · Markets · Tools).
      _(grouping now keyed on `result.type`)_
- [x] Recent searches in `localStorage` namespaced `nav.search.recent`, capped. _(cap 8, shown when
      the overlay opens with an empty query)_

### B.6 Mobile drawer

- [x] Slide-in from inline-end, full-height using `100svh` with `100vh` fallback. _(`100dvh` base +
      `@supports (height: 100svh)` override)_
- [x] Sections with group headings, dividers, large tap targets. Expandable groups (`<details>` or
      custom with `aria-expanded`), not a flat stack. _(now uses native `<details>/<summary>` with
      caret chevron)_
- [ ] Top: search input (progressive enhancement). Bottom: theme toggle + language switcher +
      primary CTA. _(bottom-cluster CSS slot `.nav-drawer-bottom` shipped; markup rewiring to move
      theme + lang into the cluster is the next step)_
- [x] `body` scroll lock while open. Close on: Escape, backdrop tap, route change.
- [x] Focus trap inside drawer. Return focus to hamburger on close.

### B.7 Scroll behavior

- [x] Hide on scroll down (> 6 px delta, after 64 px), reveal on scroll up. Throttled via
      `requestAnimationFrame`. Disabled under reduced motion. Suspended while drawer open or an open
      dropdown is present. _(`_initNavScrollBehavior` in `nav.js`; `data-nav-hidden` on `.site-nav`
      translates the shell offscreen)_

### B.8 Micro-interactions

- [x] Underline slide on hover, group fade+slide on open, theme-toggle icon cycle (auto → light →
      dark, rotate 180 ms). _(theme icon rotates to a distinct angle per mode via
      `[data-theme-mode]` attribute selectors; rotation disabled under reduced motion)_
- [x] Active-dropdown chevron flip. _(caret rotation gated by `prefers-reduced-motion`)_

### B.9 Touch behavior

- [x] No hover-only dropdowns on touch. First tap opens, tap outside closes. Tap on active trigger
      closes. _(click-to-toggle on `.nav-dropdown-btn`; outside click listener on document)_

### B.10 Dark-mode parity

- [x] All nav surfaces resolved via `--surface-*` and `--color-text-*`. Manual sweep only if token
      misuse found. _(new nav CSS block in `styles/global.css` uses tokens with safe fallbacks;
      dark-mode overrides for search overlay shipped)_

## 6. Track C — Homepage revamp

### C.1 IA & section order (first-scroll priority)

Target order:

1. Hero — live spot + freshness + trust + 2 CTAs.
2. Karat reference strip — live per-karat prices, unit toggle, copy.
3. Trust band — methodology / sources / estimated vs live legend.
4. Tools strip — Tracker · Calculator · Converter · Zakat · Alerts · Order.
5. Countries quick-picker — flag grid, searchable inline.
6. Markets highlights — top 3–6 markets with freshness.
7. Explainer strip — scannable bullets.
8. FAQ — condensed, reveal-on-scroll.
9. Social strip — minimal.
10. Deep-link footer rail.

- [ ] Dedup the overlapping "Live Gold Prices" (`gcc-section-title`) and "Karat strip" sections into
      one canonical live-price block.

### C.2 Hero rebuild

- [ ] Headline + subhead + primary CTA "Open Live Tracker" + secondary "Open Calculator".
- [ ] Inline live XAU/USD (large), delta vs prev close, 24 h high/low, freshness pill ("updated 42 s
      ago"), market-open/closed chip, trust line ("spot reference — not a retail quote").
- [ ] Mobile: stacks vertically, price block prominent, CTAs full-width.
- [ ] Canonical hero surface + gold inset ring; no bespoke gradients.

### C.3 Karat reference strip

- [ ] Per-karat cards (24K, 22K, 21K, 18K, 14K): gram price, unit toggle (g / tola / oz),
      copy-to-clipboard.
- [x] **Count-up on update.** Directional flash (green up / red down). (home only, via `countUp` —
      `14d365cc`)
- [ ] Skeleton shimmer on first load.
- [ ] Clear "reference only" framing on the strip header.

### C.4 Country quick-picker

- [ ] Flag grid deep-linking to country pages. Inline searchable (filters as you type). Keyboard
      navigable.
- [ ] Cached/stale state clearly labeled.

### C.5 Tools strip

- [ ] One row/grid, each tool: icon + name + one-line value prop + CTA. No duplicates. Primary tools
      weighted larger.

### C.6 Trust band

- [ ] Methodology link. Data-source list. AED peg note. "Estimated vs live" legend. Links to
      `methodology.html`, `about.html`.

### C.7 Markets highlights

- [ ] 3–6 top markets as cards with freshness + "reference price" framing. Deep-links to market
      pages.

### C.8 Explainer strip

- [ ] Scannable bullets, not paragraphs. Reveal-on-scroll.

### C.9 FAQ

- [ ] Tight copy, each item collapsible via `<details>`/custom with `aria-expanded`.
      One-open-at-a-time optional.

### C.10 Social + footer rail

- [ ] Minimal social; footer rail provides deep-links without duplicating nav.

### C.11 Liveness

- [x] **Section reveal-on-scroll** on trust-strip, trust-banner, tools, countries-quick, explainer,
      FAQ, social via `[data-reveal]`. (`e19aae33`)
- [ ] Hero + karat cards count-up on update (duration proportional to delta, capped). (karat strip
      done · hero pending.)
- [ ] Freshness pill re-computes exact age every second; color shifts amber → red as staleness
      crosses thresholds.
- [ ] Gentle hero-backdrop parallax (transform-only). Reduced-motion bypass.

### C.12 Content density & rhythm

- [ ] Rebalance H1/H2/H3 scale using canonical tokens. Cap body width to `--content-max-width`.
      Consistent `--rhythm-section` between sections. Remove dead space + low-signal filler.

## 7. Track D — Tracker continuation

Resume the 15-phase tracker plan in small commits:

- [x] **Phase 2** — Trust & freshness framing (exact-age pill, AED-peg note, stale/cached/fallback
      labeling with icon + tooltip). _(working tree: tracker hero, live desk summary, market/watch
      cards, and shared shell freshness now read from the same live timestamp; touched render paths
      switched to `safe-dom` helpers.)_
- [ ] **Phase 3** — Single sticky control bar
      (currency/karat/unit/compare/range/auto-refresh/language).
- [ ] **Phase 4** — Hero rebuild (large price, delta vs prev close, high/low, 24 h change,
      sparkline). Mobile-safe at 320 px.
- [ ] **Phase 5** — Chart UX (snap-to-point tooltip, per-range source labels, main-vs-compare
      legend, empty/error/stale states).
- [ ] **Phase 6** — Karat table (sticky header, `scope` attrs, bilingual labels, tap-to-copy per
      row).
- [ ] **Phase 7** — Markets grid (filter/sort/view correctness, empty states, per-country freshness,
      reference-price framing).
- [ ] **Phase 8** — Alerts/presets/planners as tabbed cards with real add/edit/delete affordances.
      Disabled-not-broken.
- [ ] **Phase 9** — Wire + archive collapsible, lazy-rendered, paginated archive, loading states.
- [ ] **Phase 12** — Replace remaining `innerHTML` sinks in `src/tracker/render.js` (24),
      `tracker-pro.js` (4), `events.js` (2), `wire.js` (3) with `safe-dom.js` helpers. Tighten
      `check-unsafe-dom` baseline in same commit block.
- [ ] **Phase 13** — Split 2,541-line `tracker-pro.css` into per-section files or prune dead rules.
      `IntersectionObserver`-gated rendering of below-fold sections.
- [x] Side-effect import of shared `reveal.js` from `src/pages/tracker-pro.js`. (`39138e7e`)
- [x] Wire + brief sections opted into `[data-reveal]`. (`1e484954`)

## 8. Track E — Motion & liveness layer

Applied on top of primitives from Track A. Rules:

- Every effect must have a **purpose**: feedback, continuity, or attention — never decorative.
- Every effect has a **reduced-motion path** that no-ops.

- [x] Price-change directional flash (green up, red down, 1 s fade). Primitive live; applied on
      karat strip. Pending on hero + tracker hero + market cards.
- [x] Number animations: count-up duration ∝ magnitude, capped 800 ms. Primitive live.
- [x] Section reveal: fade + translate-Y 8 px, 300 ms, single shared observer.
- [x] Card hover: translate-Y 2 px + shadow-up, 200 ms `--ease-out`. _(canonical `.hover-lift`
      utility in [`styles/global.css`](../styles/global.css) Motion Primitives block; opt-in,
      reduced-motion no-op.)_
- [ ] Skeletons on every async surface.
- [x] Dropdown open: fade + slide 4 px, 180 ms. _(applied on `.nav-dropdown-panel` in
      [`styles/global.css`](../styles/global.css) — `translateY(-4px) → 0`, 0.18 s
      `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`.)_
- [x] Drawer slide in 220 ms. _(applied on `.nav-drawer` in
      [`styles/global.css`](../styles/global.css) — `translateX(100%) → 0`, 0.22 s
      `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)`, visibility paired.)_
- [x] Freshness pill pulse once per tick, capped 1 per 90 s. _(primitive
      [`styles/global.css`](../styles/global.css) `@keyframes freshness-pulse` +
      `[data-freshness-pulse]` attribute; throttled helper
      [`src/lib/freshness-pulse.js`](../src/lib/freshness-pulse.js) — `pulseFreshness(el)` enforces
      90 s per-element cap, auto-clears attr after 600 ms, reduced-motion no-op. Tests:
      [`tests/freshness-pulse.test.js`](../tests/freshness-pulse.test.js).)_
- [ ] Hero parallax: transform-only on inner backdrop layer only.

## 9. Track F — Mobile & tablet

- [ ] 320–480 px no horizontal overflow on home/tracker/nav.
- [ ] 481–700 px phone-landscape & small-tablet spacing compression rules instead of premature
      desktop layout.
- [ ] 700–1024 px tablet layout — no awkward scaling, no oversized gaps, no premature column drops.
- [ ] Sticky controls with safe-area insets (`env(safe-area-inset-*)`).
- [ ] Tap targets ≥ 44 × 44 px across nav, drawer, CTA, cards.
- [ ] Chart pinch/pan sane on tracker.
- [ ] Drawer `100svh` with `100vh` fallback (iOS Safari-safe).
- [ ] Freshness pills, CTAs, and pickers legible at smallest breakpoint.

## 10. Track G — Accessibility

- [ ] `:focus-visible` rings everywhere via `--focus-ring-*`.
- [ ] Keyboard nav on groups, dropdowns, range pills, tabs, command palette.
- [ ] `aria-live="polite"` on live price cells (hero, karat strip, tracker hero).
- [ ] `aria-current="page"` on active nav item + group.
- [ ] `aria-label` on icon-only buttons; `aria-expanded`/`aria-controls` on toggles.
- [ ] Semantic HTML: `nav`, `main`, `section[aria-labelledby]`, one `h1` per page.
- [ ] Contrast audit light + dark, EN + AR.
- [ ] Touch-without-hover fallback for every hover-dependent UI.
- [ ] `role="dialog"` + focus trap on drawer + palette.

## 11. Track H — SEO & metadata

> **Audit input (2026-04-25):** [`reports/seo-audit.md`](../reports/seo-audit.md) — site-wide audit produced by the multi-track quality program ([`docs/plans/2026-04-25_multi-track-quality.md`](./plans/2026-04-25_multi-track-quality.md), Track 2 Wave A). 100% presence on `<title>` / meta-desc / canonical / `og:*` / `twitter:*` / hreflang / JSON-LD. Three Wave B fix PRs identified: (B-1) title-length trim on 394 long titles + 13 long descriptions + Tripoli disambiguation; (B-2) `FAQPage` / `WebApplication` schema + `Product`-vs-trust-label alignment + `check-jsonld-dom.js` validator; (B-3) `og:locale[:alternate]` capture + `og:url === canonical` cross-check + `og:image` dimension check.

- [ ] Unique `<title>` + `<meta name="description">` preserved on every page touched.
- [ ] Canonical `https://goldtickerlive.com/...` (apex, no www, no trailing slash inconsistencies).
- [ ] Structured data reflects each page's real purpose:
  - Home: `WebSite` + `SearchAction` + `BreadcrumbList` + `Organization`.
  - Tracker: `WebApplication`.
  - No `Product` schema on non-product pages.
- [ ] Internal linking: home ↔ tracker, calculator, shops, top country pages. Tracker ↔ calculator,
      methodology, country pages, shops.
- [ ] `sitemap.xml` correctness preserved; existing sitewide canonical test must still pass.

## 12. Track I — Perf & cleanup

- [ ] Measure initial JS + CSS for tracker and home before/after.
- [ ] Split oversized CSS files or prune dead rules (`tracker-pro.css` at 2,541 lines).
- [ ] `IntersectionObserver`-gated rendering for below-fold sections (tracker wire + archive, home
      FAQ + social + explainer).
- [ ] `loading="lazy"` + `decoding="async"` on non-critical images.
- [ ] Preconnect to data origins (`goldpricez.com`, `exchangerate-api.com`) — verified present.
- [ ] Verify `sw.js` still caches revamped assets correctly.
- [ ] Remove duplicate inline styles once systemized into classes.

## 13. Track J — Final QA

Before marking the PR ready for review:

- [ ] `npm test` — all suites pass (requires `JWT_SECRET`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `ADMIN_ACCESS_PIN`).
      Latest: **271 / 271 pass**.
- [ ] `npm run validate` — HTML + imports + DOM-sink check green; baseline tightened where sinks
      were removed. Latest: **0 errors**.
- [ ] `npm run quality` — ESLint + Prettier + Stylelint green.
- [ ] `npm run build` — Vite production build succeeds; bundle sizes reported in PR body.
- [ ] Visual screenshot diff on desktop + mobile, light + dark, EN + AR for hero, nav, drawer, karat
      strip, tools strip.
- [ ] PR body lists: what was verified, what wasn't (Lighthouse needs deploy), known risks, known
      remaining scope.

### 13.1 Per-PR verification checklist

_Absorbs `docs/product/VERIFICATION.md`. Use this before merging any PR that affects user-facing
pages._

#### Functional checks

- [ ] Primary buttons / CTAs work on target pages.
- [ ] Filters / search / sort controls update results correctly.
- [ ] Deep links and query-parameter state restore as expected.
- [ ] Local state persistence (where used) behaves correctly after refresh.
- [ ] Modal / dialog behaviour works with click, Escape, and focus flow.

#### UX and accessibility checks

- [ ] Mobile layout verified at narrow width (≥ 360 px).
- [ ] Empty / loading / error states are visible and understandable.
- [ ] Keyboard tab order is usable and skip-link path is valid.
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible on interactive controls.
- [ ] Contrast and readable hierarchy are acceptable for core flows.

#### SEO and metadata checks

- [ ] Unique `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` on changed pages.
- [ ] Canonical URL is present and points to the intended final URL.
- [ ] Open Graph + Twitter metadata are present and aligned.
- [ ] Internal links resolve from actual file depth (no broken relatives).
- [ ] Structured data (if present) matches page reality.
- [ ] Sitemap / robots impact reviewed when adding new indexable pages.

#### Trust and product clarity checks

- [ ] Spot / reference values are clearly distinguished from retail / jewelry pricing.
- [ ] Estimated / derived / cached / fallback states are labelled where relevant.
- [ ] Freshness / review-date labels are visible and not misleading.
- [ ] Shops / market listings do not overstate verification status.
- [ ] Methodology / disclaimer links remain discoverable.

#### Performance and resilience checks

- [ ] `npm run build` passes.
- [ ] Service-worker changes validated for cache version and fallback behaviour.
- [ ] No accidental broad asset / cache growth from query-param caching.

#### Final report format (required)

Every implementation update must explicitly separate:

1. **What was verified**
2. **What was not verified**
3. **Remaining risks**

Do not claim "fixed" unless the relevant checks were actually run.

---

## 14. Explicit non-goals

- **No** SPA conversion. No client-side router.
- **No** chart-library swap.
- **No** CSS/JS framework introduction (no Tailwind, React, Vue, Alpine).
- **No** rewrite of `server.js` or the admin backend.
- **No** new third-party runtime dependencies unless specifically justified (advisory-DB consulted
  first).
- **No** re-opening of already-completed work unless a regression is found.
- **No** mass content rewrites outside the sections listed here.

## 15. Reversibility & risk management

- Every commit is narrow, so `git revert <sha>` undoes exactly that concern.
- The PR can land in stages if reviewers prefer chunked review.
- Visual regressions caught via screenshot-diff in Track J; structural regressions via tests.
- Any new dependency or new DOM-sink pattern triggers a hard stop and re-evaluation.

## 16. Open questions (carry forward until answered)

1. Should the nav search be shipped in this PR or deferred (adds meaningful JS)? **Default:** ship
   behind progressive enhancement.
2. Should the homepage drop any existing sections entirely (e.g., social strip) or just
   de-emphasize? **Default:** keep all, re-rank + tighten.
3. Are bilingual strings for all new homepage copy expected in this PR or a follow-up? **Default:**
   English now, stub Arabic for follow-up.
4. Is the tracker sticky control bar OK to ship if it changes the visual identity of the page
   materially? **Default:** ship it.

### Merged PRs

_None yet._ Populate when the first revamp PR merges: PR number, merge date, branch name, range of
SHAs covered, any follow-ups.

---

## 18. Update protocol (how to keep this file honest)

1. **On every `report_progress` call**, edit this file in the same commit:
   - Tick checkboxes that completed.
   - Append a row to §17 "Progress log" with the new commit SHA and one-line summary.
   - Bump the "Last updated" banner (top of file) and "Round" counter if applicable.
2. **On PR merge**, add an entry to §17 "Merged PRs" with PR number, date, branch, SHA range, and
   migrate in-branch rows from "Round N (pending merge)" into the merged round's table.
3. **If a new track or bucket is required**, add it in the relevant section; do not invent a side
   document.
4. **If scope changes**, record the change here before coding. A scope change without a doc update
   is a scope violation.
5. **If this file is deleted, renamed, or forked**, treat that as a scope violation and restore it.

> This file replaces `docs/REVAMP_STATUS.md` for the homepage + nav + tracker revamp. Legacy tracks
> from that file remain valid for their respective scopes.

## 19. Decisions log

_Absorbs `docs/product/DECISIONS.md`. Append-only. One entry per architectural or product decision
that future agents need to know about._

### 2026-04-04 — Keep the current static architecture

- **Decision.** Keep current static multi-page architecture for now.
- **Why.** The biggest issues are trust, UX, state reliability, and SEO — not framework limitations.
- **Consequence.** Prefer targeted refactors over migrations.

### 2026-04-04 — Spot/reference vs retail, always distinguished

- **Decision.** Always distinguish spot/reference prices from retail shop prices.
- **Why.** This is core to trust.
- **Consequence.** UI labels, methodology notes, and page copy must reflect this. Codified in §0.1
  Trust guardrails and §0.2 trust snippets.

### 2026-04-22 — REVAMP_PLAN.md is the single source of truth

- **Decision.** Consolidate every planning / status / roadmap / task / audit doc into
  `docs/REVAMP_PLAN.md`. Source files become thin pointers.
- **Why.** Multiple overlapping plan docs caused drift and confusion about which file to update when
  reporting progress.
- **Consequence.** All planning edits land here. `docs/README.md` maps the pointer index. Reference
  docs (ARCHITECTURE, DESIGN_TOKENS, SEO_STRATEGY, etc.) stay independent.

---

## 20. Project memory

_Absorbs `docs/product/MEMORY.md`. Long-lived project-level facts that future contributors need.
Repository-wide memory lives in the agent memory store; this section is for facts that benefit every
contributor (human or agent)._

- Users care a lot about trust wording.
- Avoid generic "AI-looking" page layouts.
- Do not overbuild. Small reliable improvements beat broad rewrites.
- Tracker and shops pages are high priority.
- Country / city pages need strong SEO and internal linking.
- Any fallback / estimated data must be clearly labeled.
- When reviewing code, inspect relevant files before proposing architecture changes.
- Always separate review, plan, debug, and build modes.
- `buildFilters()` on the shops page already validates each dropdown value and resets invalid ones
  to `'all'` — lean on that safety net rather than duplicating validation upstream.

---

## 21. Rollout governance

_Absorbs `docs/product/ROLLOUT_GOVERNANCE.md`. Defines a safe rollout sequence and release gate for
multi-PR revamp work._

### Release waves

#### Wave 1 — Shops

Scope: `shops.html`, `shops.js`, `shops.css`.

Gate to move forward:

- Functional and trust checks pass for shops flows.
- No unresolved accessibility blockers in modal / filter path.

#### Wave 2 — Tracker

Scope: `tracker.html`, `tracker-pro.js`, `tracker-pro.css`, `tracker/` modules touched by tracker
PRs.

Gate to move forward:

- Onboarding and source-state clarity validated.
- Compare / archive / planner critical paths verified.

#### Wave 3 — Country / City / Market templates

Scope: country / city / market HTML templates and metadata / canonical / internal-link consistency.

Gate to move forward:

- Metadata parity (title / description / canonical / OG / Twitter).
- Internal links and depth-relative assets verified.

### Merge gate checklist (all waves)

- [ ] PR is narrow and task-specific.
- [ ] Verification checklist completed (§13 Track J — Final QA).
- [ ] Risks are documented (not hidden in summary copy).
- [ ] No unrelated cleanup / refactors included.

### Post-merge monitoring

After each wave merge:

1. Validate key pages render with expected assets.
2. Confirm no high-severity console / runtime breakage.
3. Confirm trust labels and disclaimers still present.
4. Confirm service-worker update behavior is stable after refresh.

### Rollback guidance

Rollback if any of the following appears in production checks:

- Broken primary navigation or blocked core flow.
- Misleading trust wording (spot vs retail ambiguity).
- Major SEO regression (missing canonical / title / meta).
- Unrecoverable JS error affecting primary page content.

Prefer reverting the smallest offending PR, then re-shipping a focused fix.

## 22. Production-revamp tracks (30-phase)

_Absorbs `docs/REVAMP_STATUS.md`. This is the longer-running production track that runs in parallel
with the homepage + nav + tracker revamp in §1–§18. Status rolls into `CHANGELOG.md` at Phase 30
(launch)._

### Track A — Stabilize

- [x] Phase 1 — Repo hygiene
  - [x] Untrack `dist/`, `playwright-report/`, `test-results/`
  - [x] Deduplicate Prettier config → `.prettierrc.json` is canonical
  - [x] Deduplicate ESLint config → `eslint.config.mjs` is canonical
- [x] Phase 2 — Workflow triage
  - [x] Fix invalid `ci.yml` (previously two concatenated YAML docs → zero jobs ran)
  - [x] Fix `perf-check.yml` (deprecated `microsoft/playwright-github-action@v1`)
  - [x] Pin Node 20 LTS across CI workflows
  - [x] `post_gold.yml` untouched (user directive)
- [x] Phase 3 — Testing foundation
  - [x] CI provides test-only `JWT_SECRET` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` / `ADMIN_ACCESS_PIN`
  - [x] Smoke suite covers 404 + country page
- [x] Phase 4 — Lint / format single source of truth
  - [x] Husky v9 pre-commit hook (lint-staged only; `npm test` removed from hook)
- [x] Phase 5 — CSP hardening
  - [x] Externalised inline gtag/clarity snippets to `assets/analytics.js` via
        `scripts/node/externalize-analytics.js` codemod (501 HTML files rewritten; 189 no-analytics
        files untouched). Idempotent `--check` mode wired into `npm run validate`.
  - [x] Dropped `'unsafe-inline'` from `scriptSrc` in `server.js` CSP.

### Track B — Backend, auth & users (not started)

- [ ] Phase 6 — Backend architecture decision & scaffolding
- [ ] Phase 7 — Supabase schema & migrations
- [ ] Phase 8 — Auth system (email OTP + OAuth)
- [ ] Phase 9 — Server API surface (`/api/v1/*`, OpenAPI spec)
- [ ] Phase 10 — User data flows (alerts, watchlist, preferences)
- [ ] Phase 11 — Admin panel consolidation + RBAC
- [ ] Phase 12 — Background jobs (price poll, alert eval, aggregates)
- [ ] Phase 13 — Notifications (email + web push)

### Track C — Product polish & trust (in progress)

- [ ] Phase 14 — Trust & labeling audit (in progress)
- [ ] Phase 15 — Shops directory trust pass (in progress — featured-section editorial footnote +
      "Directory last reviewed" label added; bilingual copy wired in `src/pages/shops.js`)
- [ ] Phase 16 — Tracker UX polish (in progress — `renderSeasonal()` now populates
      `#tp-seasonal-results` with monthly high/low/spread from `state.history`)
- [ ] Phase 17 — Calculator polish
- [ ] Phase 18 — Country / city / market pages
- [ ] Phase 19 — Educational / Learn pages
- [ ] Phase 20 — Design system completion
- [ ] Phase 21 — Accessibility audit

### Track D — Performance, SEO, monetisation (not started)

- [ ] Phase 22 — Performance budgets
- [ ] Phase 23 — SEO comprehensive pass
- [ ] Phase 24 — Ads integration (AdSense, consent banner, `ads.txt`)
- [ ] Phase 25 — Analytics & observability (Sentry, health / ready)
- [ ] Phase 26 — Deployment hardening (Docker, zero-downtime, secret scanning)

### Track E — Launch readiness (not started)

- [ ] Phase 27 — Load & resilience testing (k6, chaos, backup drill)
- [ ] Phase 28 — Legal & compliance (GDPR export / delete, cookie policy)
- [ ] Phase 29 — Docs & runbooks
- [ ] Phase 30 — Launch (tag v1.0.0, flip DNS, 48h enhanced monitoring)

### Track F — 404-hardening (shipped on `revamp/404-hardening`)

Orthogonal track completed in one focused branch. Every step landed as a tiny commit with a
`phx/NN:` prefix. The goal: eliminate broken internal links, harden 404 behavior, and add CI
guardrails so regressions get caught automatically.

- [x] **phx/01** — Baseline linkinator scan committed to `reports/links-initial.json` (28 links, 10
      broken, all flat `countries/<slug>.html` references).
- [x] **phx/02** — `404.html` pre-existing; verified content + canonical treatment.
- [x] **phx/03** — `server.js` `send404()` pre-existing with path-traversal-safe fallback.
- [x] **phx/04** — `_redirects` hardened: SPA catch-all removed, 21 country 301s added
      (`/countries/<slug>.html → /countries/<slug>/`), explicit `/* → /404.html 404`.
- [x] **phx/05** — linkinator wired into CI (`ci.yml`) with nightly job + artifact upload of
      `reports/`.
- [x] **phx/06** — AR nav data in `src/components/nav-data.js` rewritten from `../` relative hrefs
      to root-safe `/` form (98 `/` hrefs, 0 `../` remaining).
- [x] **phx/07** — `resolveHref` / `isPageMatch` hardened in `src/components/nav.js`:
      null/non-string guards, passthrough for `/`, `//`, `#`, `?`, URI schemes; root `/` now matches
      only the exact homepage.
- [x] **phx/08** — Country placeholder pages verified (all 21 present).
- [x] **phx/09** — 29 `countries/<slug>.html` references rewritten to `/countries/<slug>/` across
      top-level pages + components.
- [x] **phx/10** — 6 `guides/*.html` references rewritten to `content/guides/*.html` in
      shops/insights surfaces.
- [x] **phx/11** — `_headers` added: immutable long-cache for assets, short-cache for HTML,
      `X-Content-Type-Options` / `X-Frame-Options` / `Referrer-Policy` / `Permissions-Policy`
      globally; `/admin/*` `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` + `no-store`.
- [x] **phx/12** — `tests/e2e/nav-smoke.spec.js`: nav presence on 9 key pages + every country tile
      on `/countries/` resolves without 404.
- [x] **phx/13** — `tests/e2e/js-links.spec.js`: tracker hash deep-link round-trip + search page
      renders.
- [x] **phx/14** — Favicon / manifest / asset refs (`../favicon.svg` etc.) rewritten to root-safe
      absolute via `scripts/node/fix-asset-refs.js` (479 files).
- [x] **phx/15** — `build/generateSitemap.js` paths fixed (478 URLs, added privacy / terms /
      guides).
- [x] **phx/16** — `scripts/node/check-seo-meta.js` regression guard wired into `npm run validate`
      (canonical + hreflang on public pages, noindex on internal).
- [x] **phx/17** — Nav a11y: skip-link (WCAG 2.4.1) + focus trap inside mobile drawer + legacy-safe
      `.sr-only` with `clip-path` addition.
- [x] **phx/18** — Mobile bottom nav uses root-safe hrefs (aligned with phx/06).
- [x] **phx/19** — `scripts/node/generate-placeholders.js` pre-existing.
- [x] **phx/20** — Broken hrefs rewritten across 50 more pages via
      `scripts/node/fix-broken-hrefs.js` (top-page, guide, country-flat, country-dir rules). Asset
      audit: 0 broken ref types across 690 HTML files.
- [x] **phx/21** — Dev-mode 404 logging to `data/404-logs.json` in `server.js` (ring buffer, cap 500
      entries, no-op in production).
- [x] **phx/22** — CI enforcement flip: `scripts/node/enforce-linkcheck.js` parses the linkinator
      JSON report and fails the build on any broken internal link.
- [x] **phx/27** — This log (docs update per REVAMP_PLAN protocol).

**Verified outcomes on `revamp/404-hardening`:**

- `npm run lint` — clean
- `npm run validate` — 0 errors, 0 warnings (includes SEO + DOM-safety + inline-analytics checks)
- `npm test` — 271/271 passing
- `npm run linkcheck:report` — 28/28 OK
- Playwright chromium — 18/18 (smoke + nav-smoke + js-links) passing
- Asset audit — 0 broken reference types across 690 HTML files

## 22b. Tracker + Homepage + Admin revamp (30-phase)

_Reconciled from [`docs/plans/PLATFORM_UPGRADE_PROPOSAL.md`](./plans/PLATFORM_UPGRADE_PROPOSAL.md)
and the 2026-04-23 agent proposal. Surface-scoped supplement to §22: §22 owns cross-cutting
production phases (repo hygiene → backend/auth → launch); §22b owns the three highest-traffic UI
surfaces (`tracker.html`, `index.html`, `admin/`). Phases ship as single-concern commits per §1._

**Scope guards (non-negotiable):**

- No new backend, Supabase schema, or auth changes (preserves §14 non-goals and Wave-3 gates).
- No chart library swap (`plans/README.md` matrix row #11 rejected — keep `lightweight-charts` on
  tracker, `chart.js` on history).
- No URL hierarchy changes (matrix row #15 gated).
- No new `innerHTML` / `outerHTML` / `insertAdjacentHTML` / `document.write` sinks — every phase
  must **not raise** the baseline in `scripts/node/check-unsafe-dom.js`. Reduction is encouraged
  wherever a phase's surface touches existing sinks (notably Phases 5, 11, 24).
- No opportunistic cleanup outside a phase's surface.

**Per-phase definition of done (every commit):**

1. Update this §22b checklist and §17 "Progress log" with the commit SHA in the same commit.
2. `npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run validate`, `npm run quality`, `npm run build` all green.
3. Do not regress Phase 1 baseline counters (bundle size, sinks, a11y violations).
4. Ship bilingual (EN + AR) copy or explicitly defer with a tracked follow-up row.
5. Add/update at least one `node:test` or Playwright test for new behavior.

### Track 1 — Shared foundation

- [x] **Phase 1** — Baseline audit & telemetry snapshot. `reports/baseline-tracker.json`,
      `reports/baseline-home.json`, `reports/baseline-admin.json` record current `innerHTML` sink
      counts, LOC, and CSS size. Used as the regression yardstick for every later phase.
- [x] **Phase 2** — Shared design-token completeness. Audit `--tp-*`, homepage hero tokens,
      `admin.css` variables against `styles/global.css`; promote redefined tokens up. No visual
      change. _Audit deliverable: [`reports/token-audit.md`](../reports/token-audit.md). Finding:
      tracker is 100 % aliased to canonical; homepage consumes canonical directly; admin retains an
      intentionally divergent dark-theme palette (documented with per-token rationale). Net
      promotable tokens: 0; closed without a mechanical substitution to preserve no-visual-change
      guarantee._
- [ ] **Phase 3** — Shared chrome parity (nav/footer/skip-link, RTL, mobile drawer focus-trap).
- [ ] **Phase 4** — Trust/freshness primitive unification via `src/lib/live-status.js`. Replace
      ad-hoc freshness strings on the three surfaces without redesigning them. _Homepage
      `getMarketStatus` dedup landed (commit of this PR); tracker `render.js` + admin `pricing`
      call-sites to migrate alongside Phases 6 and 28 respectively._
- [ ] **Phase 5** — DOM-safety baseline tightening for the highest-churn `innerHTML` sinks touched
      by later phases; lower the numbers in `scripts/node/check-unsafe-dom.js`.

### Track 2 — Tracker

- [ ] **Phase 6** — Hero trust framing (`#tp-live-badge`, `#tp-xauusd-badge`, `#tp-hero-stats`) via
      the Phase 4 primitive.
- [x] **Phase 7** — State/URL-hash contract freeze. Document `src/tracker/state.js` hash schema in
      [`docs/tracker-state.md`](./tracker-state.md); add round-trip tests in
      `tests/tracker-hash.test.js`.
- [x] **Phase 8** — Mode-tabs refactor (extract `#tab-*` wiring from `ui-shell.js` into `modes.js`).
      Landed as [`src/tracker/modes.js`](../src/tracker/modes.js): pure registry of 7 tab entries (5
      modes + 2 panels), bilingual labels, workspace gates, keyboard-shortcut map. `ui-shell.js`
      consumes it for overlay construction and keyboard dispatch. Contract invariants enforced by
      [`tests/tracker-modes.test.js`](../tests/tracker-modes.test.js).
- [ ] **Phase 9** — Live-mode polish (loading skeleton, mobile pinch/pan, `aria-live="polite"`).
- [ ] **Phase 10** — Compare mode (multi-select, `el()`-only results table, spot-linked reference).
- [ ] **Phase 11** — Archive mode (pagination + CSV export; retire `innerHTML` sinks in
      `src/tracker/render.js`).
- [ ] **Phase 12** — Alerts mode (local-only, explicit "Browser-only reminder" disclaimer).
- [ ] **Phase 13** — Planner + Exports + Method (CSV/JSON/brief polish; Method links into
      `methodology.html`).
- [ ] **Phase 14** — `styles/pages/tracker-pro.css` split into per-mode files + dead-rule prune.

### Track 3 — Homepage

- [ ] **Phase 15** — Above-the-fold rebuild (§6 Track C scope) with `WebSite` + `BreadcrumbList`
      JSON-LD.
- [ ] **Phase 16** — `#hero-live-card` trust pass (`formatRelativeAge`, explicit stale state).
- [ ] **Phase 17** — Karat strip `countUp` parity across 24K–14K with directional flash.
- [ ] **Phase 18** — Day sparkline (one per karat, IntersectionObserver-gated, no new chart lib).
- [ ] **Phase 19** — Tools strip (Tracker · Calculator · Converter · Zakat · Alerts · Order) with
      root-safe `/` hrefs and bilingual labels from `translations.js`.
- [ ] **Phase 20** — Country/city linking block (8–12 curated cards, EN + AR).
- [ ] **Phase 21** — Trust & methodology band re-using §0.2 snippets.
- [ ] **Phase 22** — `src/pages/home.js` dead-import audit + below-fold lazy-load.

### Track 4 — Admin (UI-only, no server/auth changes)

- [ ] **Phase 23** — Admin chrome consolidation: `admin/shared/chrome.js` shared sidebar/header.
      Reuse `admin/supabase-auth.js`. Ship behind a shared-chrome feature gate; roll subpages in one
      at a time if parity is at risk.
- [ ] **Phase 24** — `admin/index.html` dashboard rebuild: move inline `<style>` →
      `styles/admin.css`, clean stat grid, workflow-status tiles; no new `innerHTML` sinks (current
      baseline = 7).
- [ ] **Phase 25** — `admin/login/` flow polish (honest errors, rate-limit wording matching
      `server.js` `express-rate-limit`; PIN flow matches `server/routes/admin/index.js:189-205`).
- [ ] **Phase 26** — Settings + Pricing admin pages (CRUD forms via `safe-dom.js`; "Estimate-only"
      disclaimer on overrides — admin-side echo of §0.1).
- [ ] **Phase 27** — Shops + Orders admin pages (virtualize tables > 200 rows; WhatsApp field per
      `docs/ADMIN_GUIDE.md` and matrix row #2).
- [ ] **Phase 28** — Analytics + Content + Social admin pages (read-only panels, "Last synced" label
      reusing Phase 4 primitive).

### Track 5 — Finish line

- [ ] **Phase 29** — A11y + perf final pass (Pa11y on three surfaces, Lighthouse ≥ 90 mobile, CSS/JS
      budgets in `perf-check.yml`, DOM-safety baseline tightened).
- [ ] **Phase 30** — Docs, changelog, rollout. Update `CHANGELOG.md`, this section, and
      `docs/ADMIN_GUIDE.md`; bump "Last updated"; tag release per §21 Rollout Governance.

### §22b-specific risks (mirror in §25)

- **Phase 14** — Tracker CSS split is the highest regression risk; visual-diff screenshots required
  before merge.
- **Phase 23** — Admin chrome consolidation touches all admin subsurfaces; gated behind the
  shared-chrome toggle.
- **Phase 15** — Homepage above-fold rebuild must preserve canonical / `og:url` or sitewide
  `tests/seo-sitewide.test.js` + `scripts/node/check-seo-meta.js` will fail.

## 23. Historical execution summary (20-phase revamp)

_Absorbs `docs/REVAMP_EXECUTION_SUMMARY.md`. Condensed snapshot of the earlier 20-phase mega-revamp.
Full prose originally lived in the source file and is preserved in git history; the material

## 24. Product roadmap

_Absorbs `docs/ROADMAP_IMPLEMENTATION.md`. Multi-phase roadmap for features beyond the current
revamp. Full implementation notes (env vars, code templates, SQL, cost projections) are preserved in
git history; the active deliverable inventory lives here._

### Phase 1 — Foundation & quick wins (current)

| Feature           | Status                             | Blocker                                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Premium tier      | Infra complete, code stubs present | Stripe account + price IDs, `npm i stripe`                                                                   |
| Email newsletter  | Infra complete, workflows present  | Resend account + verified sender domain                                                                      |
| Portfolio tracker | DB schema ready, UI pending        | Supabase Auth enabled; `portfolio.html` + `src/components/auth-modal.js` + `src/lib/portfolio-calculator.js` |

**Newsletter cadence** (when live): daily 07:00 Dubai (03:00 UTC) via `daily-newsletter.yml`; weekly
Sunday 18:00 Dubai (14:00 UTC) via `weekly-newsletter.yml`.

### Phase 2 — Data & social (4–6 months)

- [ ] **Multi-source price aggregation** — Kitco, LBMA, weighted average, ±2% outlier detection,
      "Price Sources" transparency modal.
- [ ] **Silver / platinum / palladium expansion** — generalise `price-calculator.js` to
      `metal-price-calculator.js`, add metal selector on tracker, create `silver.html` /
      `platinum.html` / `palladium.html`.
- [ ] **Instagram & LinkedIn automation** — visual-content generator (Puppeteer), posting scripts +
      workflows.

### Phase 3 — Platform evolution (12+ months)

- [ ] **Premium developer API** — `/api/v1/spot`, `/api/v1/price/:country/:karat`,
      `/api/v1/historical`, `/api/v1/markets`. Tiered rate limits (Free / Basic / Pro). Redis-backed
      rate limiting. API-key generation system. OpenAPI docs.
- [ ] **Interactive heatmap** — regional price heat map.
- [ ] **Crypto correlation** — gold vs BTC / ETH overlay.
- [ ] **WhatsApp / Google Sheets integrations, push notifications, multi-language expansion** —
      detail to be specified per feature.

## 25. Known issues, risks, open items

_Absorbs `docs/issues-found.md`, `docs/risks.md`, and `docs/pr-audit.md`. For deeper technical
limitations see the reference doc `docs/LIMITATIONS.md` — that file is not folded here because it is
a stable reference inventory, not an actionable backlog._

### 25.1 Active issues (actionable)

| #   | Severity | Area     | Issue                                                                                    | Owner / Next step                                                 |
| --- | -------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A1  | Low      | Ads      | `components/adSlot.js` uses placeholder `AD_PUBLISHER_ID = 'ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXX'`          | Site owner must supply real AdSense publisher ID.                 |
| A2  | Low      | SEO      | Legacy country pages (`countries/*.html`, 15 files) coexist with new hierarchical pages. | Add canonical tags pointing legacy → new, or 301 redirects.       |
| A3  | Low      | PR state | PR #77 (revert of master revamp) left **open** but no longer needed.                     | Close PR #77 — PR #76 changes are stable.                         |
| A4  | Info     | Cache    | `services/cacheLayer.js` referenced in Phase 3 spec was never created.                   | No action — `src/lib/cache.js` is functional and covers the need. |

### 25.2 Active risks (carry forward)

| #   | Risk                                                                               | Mitigation                                                                               | Residual impact                       |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| R1  | AdSense integration incomplete                                                     | Placeholder code already in place; flips live when owner supplies publisher ID.          | Low — monetisation only, no UX impact |
| R2  | Supabase anon key is committed in `config/supabase.js`                             | Anon key is designed for client-side use; Row-Level Security only exposes verified rows. | Low — intended Supabase architecture  |
| R3  | Vite / esbuild moderate vuln (≤ 0.24.2)                                            | Only affects local dev server; prod build is unaffected.                                 | None in production                    |
| R4  | GitHub Pages cannot set HTTP security headers                                      | Meta-equivalents in `.htaccess` + proper headers on Express server when self-hosted.     | Medium — CSP / HSTS meta is limited   |
| R5  | Dual routing (legacy flat `/countries/uae.html` + hierarchical `/uae/gold-price/`) | `.htaccess` redirects cover some paths; canonical tags on 97% of pages.                  | Medium — possible split link equity   |

### 25.3 PR-reconciliation audit (snapshot 2026-04-13)

- **PRs analysed:** 95 (PR #1 – #95)
- **Open at audit time:** 1 (PR #77 — revert, no longer needed)
- **Changes reflected in code:** ≈ 95 %
- **Gaps found:** only the three items in §25.1 (all Low severity)

> See `docs/pr-audit.md` (pointer) and git history for the full table. No Critical or High severity
> items were found in that audit.

### 25.4 Open questions (carry forward until answered)

Duplicated from §16 for convenience — see §16 for defaults.

1. Ship nav search in the current PR or defer? (JS weight trade-off.)
2. Drop any existing homepage sections entirely or re-rank + tighten?
3. Bilingual strings for all new homepage copy now or follow-up?
4. Is the tracker sticky control bar OK to ship if it changes the visual identity of the page
   materially?

---

## 26. Codebase architecture snapshot

_Absorbs `docs/codebase-audit.md`. A concise snapshot. For long-form module catalogues and deep
architecture notes see the reference doc `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. For design tokens see
`docs/DESIGN_TOKENS.md`._

### Routing

File-based static site with Vite build. Clean URLs via `index.html`:

| Pattern                                      | Example                                      |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Homepage                                     | `/`                                          |
| Country gold price                           | `/{country}/gold-price/`                     |
| City gold prices                             | `/{country}/{city}/gold-prices/`             |
| City gold shops                              | `/{country}/{city}/gold-shops/`              |
| Karat rate per city                          | `/{country}/{city}/gold-rate/{karat}-karat/` |
| Legacy country / city / market               | `/countries/*.html` (kept; see §25.1 A2)     |
| Tools (calc, tracker, history, order, shops) | `/calculator.html`, `/tracker.html`, etc.    |
| Admin                                        | `/admin/*` (9 pages, Supabase OAuth)         |

Route helpers: `utils/routeBuilder.js`, `utils/routeValidator.js`, `routes/routeRegistry.js`.

### Build

Vite 8 + Terser. `vite.config.js` excludes the 15 country directories, `admin/`, `embed/`, `dist/`,
`node_modules/`. Those are copied as-is by the deploy workflow. Manual chunks: `vendor`
(lightweight-charts) and `utils` (cache, api, price-calculator, formatter). See
`docs/DEPENDENCIES.md` for the version matrix.

### External APIs

| Domain                      | Purpose                                                |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `api.goldpricez.com`        | Primary XAU/USD spot (`goldPriceService.js`)           |
| `goldpricez.com`            | Fallback gold price (`lib/api.js`)                     |
| `open.er-api.com`           | FX rates (USD base) (`fxService.js`)                   |
| Supabase project URL        | Shops / settings / auth (`lib/supabase-data.js`)       |
| `api.gdeltproject.org`      | Market news (`scripts/pages/insights.js`)              |
| `raw.githubusercontent.com` | DataHub historical baseline (`lib/historical-data.js`) |

Waterfall on gold price: primary → fallback → cache → last-known with label.

### State management

- Homepage: `STATE` object in `src/pages/home.js`.
- Tracker: `src/tracker/state.js`, URL-hash serialised (`#mode=live&cur=AED&k=24&u=gram`).
- Shops: filter / shortlist state in `src/pages/shops.js`.
- Persistence: `src/lib/cache.js` wraps `localStorage`.

Key `localStorage` namespaces: `goldprices_gold_*`, `goldprices_fx_*`, `user_prefs`, `gp_pref_lang`,
`shops_shortlist`, `tracker_*`, `sb-*-auth-token`, `gp_admin_shops`.

### SEO layer

Canonical coverage ≈ 97 %. Sitemap at `/sitemap.xml` with hreflang alternates. JSON-LD: `WebSite` +
`SearchAction` + `Organization` on home; `BreadcrumbList` sitewide; `FAQPage`, `HowTo`, `Dataset` on
specific pages. `robots.txt` blocks admin, server, tests, node_modules, supabase, repositories,
dist.

### Dependencies

See `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md` for the full version matrix. Production deps: bcryptjs, cors, express 5,
express-rate-limit, helmet, jsonwebtoken, lowdb, morgan, uuid. Dev: terser, vite 8.

### CI / CD

15+ GitHub Actions workflows grouped in four tiers:

1. **Merge gate** — `ci.yml`
2. **Informational scans** — `codeql.yml`, `semgrep.yml`, `perf-check.yml`, `lighthouse.yml`
3. **Production deploy** — `deploy.yml`
4. **Content / sync bots** — `post_gold.yml`, `daily-newsletter.yml`, `weekly-newsletter.yml`,
   `uptime-monitor.yml`, `health_check.yml`, `spike_alert.yml`, `sync-db-to-git.yml`

Only `ci.yml` blocks merges. See `.github/workflows/README.md`.

## 27. Historical execution log

_Absorbs `docs/execution-log.md`. Snapshot of completed phases of the earlier multi-phase audit. The
active progress tracking continues in §17 (current revamp) and §22 (production tracks)._

### Phase 0 — Repository audit + PR reconciliation ✅

- **0A — Git history & PR audit.** 95 PRs analysed (1 open: PR #77 — revert, no longer needed). ≈ 95
  % of PR changes reflected in codebase. Gap: AdSense placeholder publisher ID. Original output:
  `docs/pr-audit.md` (now pointer).
- **0B — Codebase structural audit.** 380 HTML pages, 68 JS files, 16 CSS files. Vite build. 15+
  workflows. Supabase for admin + shops. Bilingual EN/AR. 369/380 pages have canonicals & unique
  descriptions. 205 tests passing at the time. Two moderate vulns in esbuild (no prod impact).
  Original output: `docs/codebase-audit.md` (now pointer).
- **0C — Performance baseline.** Expected Lighthouse 85–95. No blocking JS for initial paint.
  Service worker cache-first for assets, network-first for HTML. Output:
  `docs/performance-baseline.json` (retained as reference data).

### Phase 1 — PR reconciliation ✅

No Critical or High severity items found. Only the three items in §25.1 remain as Low-severity gaps.

### Phase 2 — URL architecture ✅

- `utils/routeBuilder.js` — single source of truth for URL generation (`buildRoute`,
  `buildShopsRoute`, `buildCanonicalURL`, `generateAllRoutes`).
- `utils/routeValidator.js` — validates country / city / karat param combos.
- `tests/route-utils.test.js` — 27 tests covering every route type.
- Hierarchical URLs already in place (`/{country}/{city}/gold-prices/`).

### Phase 12 — Accessibility + performance (partial) ✅

- Security meta headers (`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`,
  `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`) added to 6 main pages.
- All pages carry `lang="en"` + `dir="ltr"` (RTL switched via CSS).
- No `tabindex > 0` anywhere; no `<img>` missing alt text (flags are emoji, not images).

### Phase 13 — Security hardening (partial) ✅

- `server.js` CSP extended for AdSense, GA4, Supabase.
- `utils/inputValidation.js` — shared validators (UAE phone, email, numeric range, text
  sanitisation, URL-param sanitisation, price-alert validation).
- `tests/input-validation.test.js` — 31 tests.
- `.env.example` created; `docs/environment-variables.md` retained as reference.

### Phase 15 — CI/CD + tests (partial) ✅

- `ci.yml` runs on PR to `main`; `deploy.yml` on push to `main`.
- 205 tests passing at audit time (now 231+; see §26 CI / CD).
- 15+ workflows across CI, deploy, monitoring, social posting.

### Phases 3–11, 14 — status at audit

Already substantially implemented — see `services/`, `lib/cache.js`, `lib/api.js`,
`components/chart.js`, 380 pages with prices, shops, charts, `seo/metadataGenerator.js` (97 %
canonical coverage), 9 admin pages with Supabase auth, `order-gold/` with WhatsApp + Supabase,
`social/postTemplates.js` (10 templates), `search/searchEngine.js` (bilingual fuzzy),
`config/translations.js` + RTL CSS. Only Phase 11 (monetisation) remains partial — blocked on a real
AdSense publisher ID (see §25.1 A1).

---

## 29. Repo hygiene pass

_Reconciled from [`docs/plans/REPO_CLEANUP_PROPOSAL.md`](./plans/REPO_CLEANUP_PROPOSAL.md) on
2026-04-23. Audit-first / delete-last. Phases 2+ are gated by owner sign-off on
`reports/cleanup-audit/CANDIDATES.md`._

**Branch:** `copilot/clean-repo-files-dead-code`

### Scope

Reduce dead code, dead files, and stale artifacts across the repo without altering any public URL,
breaking any CI gate, or weakening SEO/trust surfaces. Preserve the static multi-page architecture.

### Guardrails (binding for every PR in this track)

- Never delete `**/*.html` under `countries/`, `content/`, `admin/`, or repo root as cleanup.
- Never delete anything listed in `sitemap.xml`, `_redirects`, `_headers`, `.htaccess`,
  `robots.txt`, `manifest.json`, `sw.js`, `CNAME`.
- Never modify `data/shops.js`, DataHub baseline CSVs, or pre-build outputs (`assets/`, `config/`,
  `data/`) as cleanup.
- One subsystem per PR. ≤ ~50 files per removal PR.
- Never force-push; never rewrite history.
- DOM-safety baseline (`check-unsafe-dom`) and SEO/sitemap gates must stay green or tighten.
- Out of scope: version bumps, architecture changes, directory reorgs, content rewrites, new
  features, new pages, URL changes.

### Phase checklists

#### Phase 0 — Reconcile into the plan system

- [x] `docs/plans/REPO_CLEANUP_PROPOSAL.md` created with raw prompt + plan
- [x] Row added to "Pending proposals" in `docs/plans/README.md`
- [x] Sub-tasks scored into the priority matrix (rows 15a–15g, Wave 2/3)
- [x] This subsection (§29) added to `REVAMP_PLAN.md`

#### Phase 1 — Baseline audit (read-only, zero deletions)

- [ ] Inventory: full file list with size + last-modified + last-touched commit SHA
- [ ] Reachability graph (HTML→assets, JS imports, CSS imports, config refs, runtime refs, test
      refs, workflow refs, dynamic refs)
- [ ] Keep-list per `REPO_CLEANUP_PROPOSAL.md` §Phase 1.3
- [ ] Candidate-list bucketed A / B / C
- [ ] Dead-code-inside-live-files audit: knip (or ts-prune), depcheck, purgecss (report-only), ruff
      F401/F811/F841, eslint unused-vars (non-blocking)
- [ ] `reports/cleanup-audit/CANDIDATES.md` committed with empty checkboxes for owner sign-off
- [ ] PR opened: "repo hygiene: audit-only (no deletions)"
- [ ] **STOP — owner reviews `CANDIDATES.md` and checks off approvals before Phase 2+**

#### Phase 2 — Trivially safe removals (Bucket A only, owner-approved)

- [ ] One category per commit (`.DS_Store`, editor swaps, zero-byte, orphan `.map`, byte-identical
      duplicates)
- [ ] `.gitignore` hardened (`Thumbs.db`, `*~` confirmed; `.DS_Store` and `*.swp` already present)
- [ ] Per-PR gates: `npm run lint`, `npm run validate`, `npm test`, `npm run build`,
      `npm run quality`
- [ ] No public HTML changed

#### Phase 3 — Script & module orphans (Bucket B, one-at-a-time)

- [ ] Re-verify each file unreferenced at HEAD
- [ ] Dynamic-ref grep across repo + workflows + docs + `dist/`
- [ ] `npm run build` output byte-diff acceptable
- [ ] One subsystem per PR; one-line `CHANGELOG.md` "Internal" entry per removal

#### Phase 4 — Dead exports inside live files (no file removal)

- [ ] Per knip / ts-prune output, confirm zero consumers (incl. tests + workflows)
- [ ] Remove export; remove body if no internal consumer
- [ ] Group edits by module
- [ ] **Do not** touch `src/lib/safe-dom.js` or `src/lib/cache.js` fallback paths

#### Phase 5 — Dependencies

- [ ] depcheck-flagged unused deps removed; cross-checked against workflow refs
- [ ] `npm audit` + full test + build green
- [ ] No version bumps

#### Phase 6 — CSS / style hygiene (report-first)

- [ ] purgecss-flagged class selectors removed (class-based only)
- [ ] Protected primitives kept: `hover-lift`, `data-freshness-pulse`, `data-reveal`,
      `flash-up/down`, `pulse-dot`, `drawer-slide-in`
- [ ] Playwright visual smoke (where available) green on home / tracker / shops / country-page

#### Phase 7 — Docs hygiene (non-destructive)

- [ ] Identify clearly superseded docs vs `REVAMP_PLAN.md`
- [ ] **Archive** under `docs/archive/YYYY-MM/`, do not delete
- [ ] `docs/README.md` index updated
- [ ] Governance files never archived: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `REVAMP_PLAN.md`, `plans/README.md`

#### Phase 8 — Formatting-only pass (default skip)

- [ ] _Default: skip._ Run only if explicitly requested
      (`chore: format only (no semantic     changes)`).

#### Phase 9 — Final validation

- [ ] `npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run validate`, `npm run quality`, `npm run build`,
      `npm run perf:ci`, `npm run check-links`, `npm run a11y`, `npm run seo-audit`
- [ ] `dist/` sitemap diff: every public URL still ships
- [ ] DOM-safety baseline untouched or tightened
- [ ] Deploy preview smoke: home, tracker, shops, calculator, insights, one country, one city, one
      market, 404, offline
