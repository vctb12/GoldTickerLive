# Data-source methodology

This is the canonical reference for how Gold Ticker Live takes a raw gold quote from any provider
and turns it into the prices the site displays and the bot tweets.

The same pipeline applies to every adapter in `scripts/python/gold_providers/`; nothing
provider-specific leaks into display or social copy.

---

## 1. Constants

```python
TROY_OUNCE_GRAMS = 31.1034768   # international troy ounce → grams
DEFAULT_AED_PEG  = 3.6725       # USD → AED, UAE Central Bank pegged rate
DEFAULT_MAX_FRESHNESS_SECONDS = 900   # 15 minutes
DEFAULT_MIN_VALID_XAU_USD = 500       # sanity floor (rejects "$0.50/oz")
DEFAULT_MAX_VALID_XAU_USD = 10000     # sanity ceiling
```

Overridable via env vars `AED_PEG`, `MAX_GOLD_FRESHNESS_SECONDS`, `MIN_VALID_XAU_USD`,
`MAX_VALID_XAU_USD`.

The AED peg is fixed by the UAE Central Bank — we do not derive it from a forex feed. If the peg
ever changes, update the env var; the math reflects it immediately.

## 2. AED math

```
usd_per_gram_24k = xau_usd_per_oz / TROY_OUNCE_GRAMS
aed_per_gram_24k = usd_per_gram_24k * AED_PEG
```

Lower karats are derived by purity ratio (in tracker code, not in the fetcher) —
`22K = 24K × 22/24`, `21K = 24K × 21/24`, `18K = 24K × 18/24`. The site is honest that retail
(jewelry shop) prices include making charges, VAT, and dealer premium **on top** of these
spot-derived references; no provider quote is presented as a retail/jewelry price.

## 3. Normalized schema

Every adapter emits — through `gold_providers.normalize.normalize_quote()` — a payload with this
shape (schema_version=1):

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "provider": "twelvedata_xauusd",
  "provider_url": "https://twelvedata.com/",
  "source_type": "spot_reference",
  "raw_symbol": "XAU/USD",
  "quote_currency": "USD",
  "xau_usd_per_oz": 4550.0,
  "usd_per_gram_24k": 146.2875,
  "aed_per_gram_24k": 537.3,
  "aed_peg": 3.6725,
  "timestamp_utc": "2026-05-01T10:00:00Z",
  "timestamp_source": "provider",
  "fetched_at_utc": "2026-05-01T10:00:10Z",
  "freshness_seconds": 10,
  "max_freshness_seconds": 900,
  "is_fresh": true,
  "is_fallback": false,
  "bid": null,
  "ask": null,
  "spread": null,
  "provider_response_time_ms": 220,
  "notes": null
}
```

### `source_type`

Values listed in priority order — defaults to `spot_reference` unless the provider clearly proves
real live spot:

- `spot_live` — sub-minute live spot, dealer-grade.
- `spot_reference` — quoted as XAU/USD spot but with vendor caveats (e.g. Twelve Data, GoldAPI.io).
  **The default for most adapters.**
- `spot_delayed` — 5–15 minute delayed spot.
- `futures_reference` — futures (e.g. FMP GCUSD = COMEX). Tweet copy is required to disclose this.
- `commodity_reference` — broader commodity index, not pure XAU/USD.
- `daily_fix` — once-a-day fix (LBMA / kitco AM/PM).
- `cache_last_known` — provider returned a cached/last-known value (e.g. weekend).
- `unknown` — adapter could not classify; conservative default.

### `timestamp_source`

- `provider` — extracted from the API response.
- `missing` — provider returned no timestamp; `is_fresh` is forced to `false`.

### `is_fresh`

`fetched_at_utc - timestamp_utc <= max_freshness_seconds`. If `timestamp_source == "missing"`,
`is_fresh` is always `false`.

### `is_fallback`

`true` when the orchestrator had to use a stale quote (with `ALLOW_STALE_PRICE=true`) or a
circuit-breaker fallback. Tweet copy must add a "(fallback source)" disclaimer when this is `true`.

## 4. Error categories

Every failure path uses one of the canonical categories in
[`gold_providers.base.ERROR_CATEGORIES`](../scripts/python/gold_providers/base.py):

`missing_api_key`, `provider_disabled`, `network_error`, `timeout`, `http_error`, `auth_error`,
`rate_limited`, `quota_exhausted`, `malformed_json`, `missing_price`, `missing_timestamp`,
`stale_timestamp`, `sanity_range_failed`, `unsupported_symbol`, `plan_gated`, `terms_unclear`,
`unknown_error`.

The bakeoff log and scorecard both depend on these names being stable and lowercase-snake-case.
Never invent new categories without adding them to `ERROR_CATEGORIES` first.

## 5. Sanity range

Every adapter rejects prices outside `[MIN_VALID_XAU_USD, MAX_VALID_XAU_USD]` with
`sanity_range_failed`. This catches obvious malformed responses (e.g. a provider returning grams
instead of ounces) before they propagate to display or X.

## 6. Provider-state circuit breaker

`scripts/python/fetch_gold_price.py` keeps `data/provider_state.json` with per-provider:

- `consecutive_failures` (resets to 0 on success).
- `last_success_utc` / `last_failure_utc`.
- `last_error_category`.
- `circuit_open_until_utc` — when set and `> now`, the provider is skipped for that round.

Open-window heuristics:

- `rate_limited` / `quota_exhausted` → open for 60 minutes.
- 3 consecutive failures of any other category → open for 30 minutes.

This avoids burning quota on a provider that is currently failing, without permanently disabling it.

## 7. Backwards compatibility

The legacy `data/gold_price.json` consumed `gold.ounce_usd` from a GoldPriceZ-shaped object. Until
the migration flips, the legacy fetcher (`scripts/fetch_gold_price.py`) keeps writing that shape.

The new fetcher (`scripts/python/fetch_gold_price.py`) writes the normalized schema above. When we
flip production:

- Tracker pages and downstream consumers read the new schema.
- The X bot reads the same file via `tweet_guard` which understands the new fields (`is_fresh`,
  `is_fallback`, `source_type`, `timestamp_utc`).
- Anything that still wants the legacy field names can compute them from the normalized payload
  (`xau_usd_per_oz` is `gold.ounce_usd`).

See [`gold-price-provider-migration.md`](./gold-price-provider-migration.md) for the migration steps
and rollback plan.

## 8. Historical data layers and limitations

Gold Ticker Live uses three data layers for historical price display, archive browsing, and exports.
Understanding their resolution and limitations is important for honest display.

### Layer 1 — Monthly LBMA baseline (embedded)

- **Source:** LBMA PM fix monthly average data (public domain records)
- **Resolution:** One data point per calendar month (YYYY-MM)
- **Coverage:** 2019-01 onwards; baseline file: `src/data/historical-baseline.json`
- **Freshness state:** `historical`
- **Limitations:**
  - Embedded in the codebase; requires a code update to add new months
  - Monthly averages are not intraday prices; they smooth within-month volatility
  - Any `estimated: true` entries are approximate and labelled accordingly in the UI

### Layer 2 — Daily cached browser snapshots

- **Source:** Locally cached browser snapshots (localStorage) captured while the tracker is open
- **Resolution:** One data point per calendar day (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Coverage:** Up to 90 days back from the current session
- **Freshness state:** `cached`
- **Limitations:**
  - Coverage depends on how often the user visits; gaps appear for days the tracker was not open
  - Data is browser-local — different devices have independent caches

### Layer 3 — Live session ticks

- **Source:** Real-time gold-api.com spot snapshot (server hourly + client ~90 s re-poll)
- **Resolution:** ~90-second ticks
- **Coverage:** Current session duration only
- **Freshness state:** `live` or `cached` depending on whether the fetch succeeded

### Merged view

`getUnifiedHistory()` in `src/lib/historical-data.js` merges all three layers:

1. Start with the full monthly baseline
2. Overlay daily cached snapshots (daily points are added; monthly baseline entries for that month
   are marked `superseded`)
3. The chart and archive render the merged, de-duplicated result

For long date ranges (1Y, 3Y, 5Y, ALL) where daily snapshots don't reach, the view falls back
entirely to the monthly baseline. Resolution is clearly labelled via `describeHistoryResolution()`.

### Export metadata

Every CSV and JSON export includes:

- `dataResolution` — describes the resolution mix (monthly / daily / mixed)
- `freshnessState` — describes the freshness of each row (`historical`, `cached`, `live`)
- `disclaimer` — explicit statement that values are spot-linked reference estimates, not retail
  prices
- `aedPeg` — confirms the fixed 3.6725 rate
- `limitations` — describes the baseline coverage gap and session-cache dependency

### Baseline coverage note

The monthly baseline was last updated to cover through **2025-08**. Any periods after that date use
live or cached session snapshots for short ranges, and show no data for long ranges that extend into
uncovered months. The UI notes the actual baseline range dynamically via `getBaselineRange()`.

To extend the baseline, add new entries to `src/data/historical-baseline.json` following the
existing `{ "date": "YYYY-MM", "price": <XAU/USD monthly average> }` format. Use verified LBMA data
only; mark estimated entries with `"estimated": true`.
