# Revamp Status — transient

Tracking carry-over debt during the 30-phase production revamp. **This file is deleted at Phase 30
(launch); its contents roll into `CHANGELOG.md`.**

## Track A — Stabilize

- [x] Phase 1 — Repo hygiene
  - [x] Untrack `dist/`, `playwright-report/`, `test-results/`
  - [x] Deduplicate Prettier config → `.prettierrc.json` is canonical
  - [x] Deduplicate ESLint config → `eslint.config.mjs` is canonical
- [x] Phase 2 — Workflow triage
  - [x] Fix invalid `ci.yml` (previously two concatenated YAML docs → zero jobs ran)
  - [x] Fix `perf-check.yml` (deprecated `microsoft/playwright-github-action@v1`)
  - [x] Pin Node 20 LTS across CI workflows
  - [x] `post_gold.yml` untouched (user directive)
- [x] Phase 3 — Testing foundation
  - [x] CI provides test-only `JWT_SECRET` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` / `ADMIN_ACCESS_PIN`
  - [x] Smoke suite covers 404 + country page
- [x] Phase 4 — Lint / format single source of truth
  - [x] Husky v9 pre-commit hook (lint-staged only; `npm test` removed from hook)
- [ ] Phase 5 — CSP hardening
  - [ ] Remove inline `<script>` gtag/clarity snippets (deferred to follow-up PR)
  - [ ] Drop `'unsafe-inline'` from `scriptSrc` after report-only bake-in

- [ ] Phase 10 — User data flows (alerts, watchlist, preferences)
